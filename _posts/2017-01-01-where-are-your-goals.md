<h2>Happy 2017 Everyone</h2>
*(well, at least at the time of this writing)*

It's 12:23 AM on Janurary 1st, 2017, my kids are sound asleep, my wife finally just went to bed (I got her to actually stay up with me for the ball drop this year, went to bed right after), and I'm fairly drunk by this point, so what better time to write another blog post?

As I scroll down my Facebook feed, I contanstly see more and more statuses about the new year, to which I can pretty much sum most of all up with the simple, yet cliche phrase of *"new year new me."*

Ok, I get it. It's a new year, you want to start bettering yourself. You want to read more. You want to eat better. You want to start going to the gym for 60 minutes at least 3 times a week. Tis' the season to start making goals that you'll give up on within the first 9 days. 

Sound cynical? Well, it may be the bottle of champagne that I'm trying to finish all by myself now, or it may be the sad fact that we for some reason need some artificial date such as the beginning of a *New Year* to start bettering ourselves.

My main point of this blog post is to ask the question, **Why do you need to wait to start your goals?**

One main answer to this is question, and I completely agree, is that: <h3>A goal that plans to succeed has had successful planning.</h3>

In order to succeed in your goals, you need preperation. Read this post here if you want help on making a goal. But there is no purpose of waiting for some artificial date such as a new year just to start achiving your goal.

My philosophy is that once you're done planning on your goal, just start. Don't wait until the New Year, don't wait until the first of the month, don't wait until *"blah blah blah"*, just start.

I'm a prior smoker, and before I actually quit, I've tried quitting plenty of times. A smoker for nearly 7 years, I've tried to quit a dozen of times. I remember everytime I've attempted to quit was something of the similar of *"I'll quit after this pack"* or *"I'll quit after next month"* or *"My New Year's resolution is to quit smoking!"*

The problem with this type of planning is not that you're giving yourself a set date to start achieving your goal, it's that you're giving yourself an extended opportunity to continue your (what I see as, an) addiction. By stating *"I'll start next month or I'll start [enter your pathetic phrase]"*, you're allowing yourself to knowingly continue your faults. Even if you intend to fully commit to your goal, by stating you're not going to start *right now* is allowing you to convince yourself that it's O.K. to continue your habits for *just a little bit longer.* My point...

<h3>STOP PROCRASTINATING</h3>

When you think of your next goal, when you notice you have a faul, when you realize that there's a specific area where you can better yourself, understand that there's only two real steps involved: **Plan** and **Execute**.
